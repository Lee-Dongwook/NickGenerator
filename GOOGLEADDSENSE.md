### Pre-Approval Domain & AdSense Rules

   - Use a free domain for building the MVP.
   - Implement all features, content, and SEO structure.
   - Test profanity/unsafe word filtering and user experience.

2. **Approval Readiness**
   - Once content, pages, and functionality are complete, get my approval (OK sign).

3. **Domain Purchase & Deployment**
   - Buy a paid domain (.com/.net/.site/.kr recommended).
   - Connect the domain to your hosting (Vercel/Netlify) with HTTPS enabled.
   - Keep URL structure consistent with testing version.

4. **Final Content & Policy Check**
   - Main page: 800–1200 words, SEO keywords included.
   - Subpages: 3–5 pages, each optimized for relevant keywords.
   - Policy pages: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, About/Contact.
   - Ensure no copyright issues and profanity filter works.

5. **Technical Verification**
   - SSR works correctly (Next.js App Router).
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
   - Loading speed under 3 seconds.
   - No 404/500 errors.

6. **SEO & Structure**
   - Single <h1> per page, proper <h2>/<h3> hierarchy.

8. **Final Action**
   - After all checks and approval sign, deploy the paid domain and apply for AdSense immediately.
